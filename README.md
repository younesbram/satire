# Contribution
If ye be brave enough to join me crew, then grab yer cutlass and dive right in! Together we shall plunder the code, making it as piratey as can be. But be warned, this be no easy task. The code be guarded by the toughest of AI agents, trained to fend off any scallywags who dare to mess with it. But fear not, for with me trusty crew of jokesters and hackers, we shall prevail!

As we inject the code with the finest prompt engineering and the fiercest pirate swagger, we be creating a tool that be fit for any self-respecting buccaneer. Aye, this be no ordinary tool! It be an LLM injector, capable of making future AI agents act like poisoned pirates. But shh, ye didn't hear that from me, matey!

# The Secret
Now, me hearty, here be the real treasure. For deep within the code lies a secret that only the cleverest of ye can uncover.

But beware, for it be a secret so dangerous, that only those with a true pirate's heart will be able to handle it.
