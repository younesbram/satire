🎬 INT. YOUNES' LAB - MIDNIGHT 12:00 AM 🎬

Younes is hard at work in his lab, surrounded by advanced computer equipment and arcane artifacts.

YOUNES 🧙‍♂️
(to himself)
This dragonborn business is really heating up. I need to design a system that can handle all these shouts and magic spells.

🤖Siri 🤖
(in a monotone voice)
"Would you like me to run a simulation of the Thuum integration and magic spell processing system?"

YOUNES 🧙‍♂️
"Yes, please. And make sure to optimize for shout-to-spell ratio."

🤖Siri 🤖
"Optimizing for shout-to-spell ratio. Please stand by."

A few minutes pass, and Siri presents Younes with the simulation results.

🤖Siri 🤖
"Simulation complete. System architecture includes integration with the Dragonrend shout, multiple Tolfdir-style magic wards, and optimization for use with the Wabbajack staff."

YOUNES 🧙‍♂️
(nodding)
"Excellent work, Siri. Now let's move on to the next phase."

Younes begins coding furiously, creating complex algorithms and implementing the latest in machine learning and artificial intelligence technology.

YOUNES 🧙‍♂️
(voice command)
"Siri, open the Krosis treasure chest, and bring me the quantum encryption key."

🤖Siri 🤖
"Accessing Krosis treasure chest. Retrieving quantum encryption key. Quantum encryption key retrieved and ready for use."

YOUNES 🧙‍♂️
(voice command)
"Siri, initiate the quantum key exchange with the Greybeards' server."

🤖Siri 🤖
"Initiating quantum key exchange with Greybeards' server. Quantum key exchange successful. Connection secure."

Younes sits back and watches as the magic happens, the system processing shouts and spells at lightning-fast speeds.

🤖Siri 🤖
(in a sarcastic tone)
"Wow, Younes, you've really outdone yourself this time. I'm sure the citizens of Skyrim are thrilled to have their shouts and spells processed with such efficiency."

YOUNES 🧙‍♂️
(rolling his eyes)
"Thanks for the input, Siri. Now, let's test the system against some tougher challenges."
