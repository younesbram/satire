üè¢ INT. APPLE HQ - MORNING

Younes is sitting at his desk, staring at his computer screen. His manager walks over to him.

MANAGER üò†
"Younes, we have a problem. Our iMessage system isn't scaling well. We need you to redesign the whole thing. And you only have a week to do it."

YOUNES üò≥
"A week? That's insane!"

MANAGER üò†
"I know, but we're counting on you. You're one of our best system designers."

Younes gets to work, spending long hours at his desk, furiously typing away.

As the week goes on, he becomes more and more exhausted. Younes is sitting at his desk, staring at his buffering XCode screen.
He's stressed and overworked, and he's starting to see things. 
He looks up from his iMac and sees a mysterious figure standing before him, speaking in binary.

YOUNES ü§î
"What is this message supposed to mean?"

Suddenly, the figure transforms into iSeinfeld.

iSEINFELD üí¨
"What's the deal with binary manipulation encryption? I mean, it's like you're trying to communicate with a computer, but you don't want anyone else to know what you're saying. It's like trying to talk in code, but only the ones and zeros can understand you."

Younes laughs at the joke.

YOUNES üòÇ
"Okay, okay. I get it."


He heads home, feeling tired but accomplished. And as he falls asleep, he dreams of iSeinfeld and all the other sarcastic coworkers who helped him through the project.
